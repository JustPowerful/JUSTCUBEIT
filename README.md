# "JustCubeIt" OpenSource Unity Game Project

 I started this game on 2018 when i was 15 years old , i didn't complete the whole project because it can take more time so i made some random spawners that will make the game Level **Unlimited** .
 
 **you may ask:**
 - Why you didn't complete this project since 2018 ?
 > i didn't complete the project because im studying ...
 - This Project is meaningless !
 > i know , thats why i made it an opensource project ...
